# GitWorkshop
just a small git workshop for gamejams.

## General

### 1 File 1 Person principle
To avoid conflicts, it is best to have only one person responsible for one file.
In order to reduce coordination efforts it is suggested to have personal directories for your private playgrounds (especially Scenes)

example Unity
```
/Assets/Scenes/mainScene1.scene
/Assets/Scenes/level1.scene
/Assets/Scenes/thomas/testScenePhysics.scene
/Assets/Scenes/anita/testSceneAirplane.scene
/Assets/Prefabs/
```

## Unity3D

- use your own playground scene (don't do testing / firther development of assets in )
